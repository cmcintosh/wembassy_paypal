Current State: Extremely Early Alpha

This project was inspired by the lack of resources being spent towards moving
Drupal 7 modules to Drupal 8, and by the need to provide customers with reliable and long term secure solutions for their payment needs.

Ideas / Goals:
First step is to get functionality back available for Commerce for Drupal 8 sites at current time, its not possible and seems like it is not a focus of the current project maintainers.

Second goal would be to get this functionality setup in a way that it could integrate with other Store providers.

How You Can Contribute:
You can help me by contributing Pull Requests or supporting my efforts monetarily although at this stage its a bit early to ask for either, for now Moral support would be the best way.
